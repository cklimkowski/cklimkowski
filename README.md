### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Cyprian (ËˆsÉªprÉªÉ™n ).
I am an IT professional experienced within many computer science fields.
My background consists of both theoretical and applied computing knowledge.
I provide effective solutions utilizing high- and low-level code approaches, currently especially in RPA area.

My love to computers began a long long time ago ;). The first computer I had was Atari on which I digged deep into LOGO - my first computing language.
Then I jumped quickly into PCs computing world with my brand new Pentium 200 MMX, which I was very proud of at that time it was a mind blowing.
Of course a first choice of all was beloved and famous ANSI C Language, which is in my opinion a god father of almost all modern languages.
Then were in sequence: Linux bash scripting, C++, HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, Assembler, Javascript, Turbo Pascal, UML, J2SE, J2EE, Spring, Hibernate, Junit, Typescript, Angular and Play Framework, Python, Visual Basic, UiPath, AA, Celonis...
